		<h2>Mentoring Groups</h2>
		<p>I am excited about this mentorship because I trained in an unrelated field and I could really use some advice and encouragement from experienced programmers. I’ve also only used Github for backups; I’m looking forward to learning how to use it to collaborate.</p>
		<p>I would like to be a part of the JavaScript and/or Databases and Big Data groups. I’m hoping to come out of this mentorship with an impressive DataViz project of some sort.</p>
