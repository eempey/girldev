		<p>I am a self-taught web developer. I learn what I need when I need it. I started off tweaking WordPress themes for my own sites and moved on to customizing & developing themes for clients. Most of my paid coding experience up to this point has been designing & tweaking themes for various content management systems. These include Wordpress, Joomla, BigCommerce and 3dCart. This usually involves figuring out the templating structure of the CMS and working custom HTML and CSS into it. I have picked up quite a bit of PHP from working on Wordpress sites.</p>
		
		<p>I am continually working on becomming a better programmer through books, tutorials and coding challenges.</p>
		
		<p>I have a Bachelor’s degree in International Relations and a Master’s in Journalism, both from UBC. I am looking for creative ways to combine my journalism background with programming. What I would like to be able to do is scrape & harvest data and tell stories with it in visually appealing ways. I am inspired by people like Nathan Yau from <a href="http://flowingdata.com/" target="_blank">Flowing Data</a>, and Mike Bostock, who wrote the <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3 JavaScript library</a>.</p>
